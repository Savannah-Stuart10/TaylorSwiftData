I'm just a girl tryna find a place in this world.
Honestly, I just wanted to make a few things code-related and thought I could do it with Taylor Swift data. 

For future projects, I'm interested in using spotify or apple music data to populate a list of top-played TS music

I'm also interested in making a quiz-like game that takes all her music and sorts it into the types of songs they are. 
This quiz would ask questions based on the type of music that one likes to listen to, what they are in the mood for, etc. 

Let me know if you have any ideas for future projects! I would love to make them happen :)
